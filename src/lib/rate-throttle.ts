/**
 * Sliding-window rate throttle for the `create-batch --run` fan-out.
 *
 * Tracks the wall-clock timestamps of `acquire()` calls inside a rolling
 * time window (`windowMs`). When the number of acquired slots in the window
 * reaches `maxPerWindow`, `acquire()` returns the number of milliseconds the
 * caller should sleep before proceeding, such that the oldest slot in the
 * window will have aged out by the time the caller resumes.
 *
 * This is intentionally a simple in-process sliding-window counter — it does
 * NOT coordinate across separate CLI processes. Cross-process collisions are
 * handled by the per-trigger `RATE_LIMITED` retry path in `runBatchRun`.
 *
 * @example
 *   const throttle = new RateThrottle(50, 60_000);
 *   const waitMs = throttle.acquire();
 *   if (waitMs > 0) await sleep(waitMs);
 *   // … fire the trigger …

   * Prunes expired slots (older than `windowMs` ago), then:

   *    current timestamp and returns `0` (no delay needed).
   *  - If the window is full: returns the delay in milliseconds until the
   *    oldest slot ages out. Does NOT record a new slot — the caller must
   *    call `acquire()` again after sleeping to claim the freed slot.
   *
   * This means callers should loop:
   *
   *   ```ts
   *   let wait: number;
   *   while ((wait = throttle.acquire()) > 0) {
   *     await sleep(wait);
   *   }
   *   ```
   *
   * Returns `0` when a slot was successfully acquired.
